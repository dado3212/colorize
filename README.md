### The Problem
If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, it can be really hard to pinpoint a specific color.

### The Solution
I created Colorize a while ago in order to turn a word/phrase into a hex color.  It works by scraping the first page of Google Image results for the word/phrase, and finding the average color for the returned images.

### Details
If you're running this on a local server, make sure that php-gd is installed, and the 'php_gd2' extension is enabled.
